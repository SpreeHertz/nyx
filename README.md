# How To Run The Bot

Make sure you have Python 3 and the discord.py library installed on your computer. You can install discord.py using the following command: pip install discord.py

Create a new Discord bot by following the instructions here. This will give you a bot token that you will need in the next step.

Clone the Nyx Discord bot repository to your computer using the following command: git clone https://github.com/zaidlab/Nyx-Discord-Bot.git

Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open the bot.py file in a text editor.

Replace TOKEN in the bot.run() line with your bot's token.

Run the bot using the following command: python bot.py

Add the bot to your Discord server by following the instructions here.

Once the bot is added to your server, you can use the commands listed in the bot.py file to interact with it. For example, you can use the !schedule command to schedule an event, or the !poll command to create a poll.
